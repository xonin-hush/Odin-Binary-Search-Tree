# Odin-Binary-Search-Tree

Ninth project in "The Odin Project" JavaScript Course, it demonstrates Balanced Binary Tree data structure. [The Odin Project-JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript).

## Things I got a better understanding of

- Balanced Binary Trees
- LevelOrder (breadth first search)
- Classes and Objects
- Returns really matter in recursive methods
- Can't remove or set a node to null so the method for doing that is ==> parent.wantedChild=null and not wantedChild=null
